- The application consists of 2 modules.
- An app modules:
    - `InstrumentationAgent`: In this module exist class was designed to work as a Java agent that can be loaded into a
      Java application to measure the size of objects in memory using the `Instrumentation API`. It's important to
      initialize the globalInstrumentation field with a valid Instrumentation instance using the premain method before
      calling `getObjectSize`;
